# About me

I am a passionate and experienced language technologist and web developer. I like everything related to languages: studying them and researching them - but also figuring out how to make computers understand and produce them. In the field of language technology, I am particularly fascinated by large neural language models, such as GPT and BERT, and their utilization for various downstream tasks (such as question answering or text generation).

I have an MA in Language Technology from the University of Helsinki. Along with my language technology studies, I also became interested in web development, especially front-end, and I also completed a lot of computer science studies. I have also noticed that I enjoy designing websites and UIs.

My work history is extensive; I have worked e.g. as an IT support agent, a localization engineer and a front-end developer ([Revita project](https://revita.cs.helsinki.fi/)). More information about my education and work history can be found on my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilmari-kylli%C3%A4inen-71a1a818a/).

I am currently looking for new challenges. Ideally, these challenges could involve front-end development/design, but they could potentially also have an NLP angle. I am currently located in Helsinki.
