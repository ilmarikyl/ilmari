# About me

As an experienced language technologist and web developer, I am deeply passionate about languages - not only studying and researching them but also exploring ways to make computers understand and generate them. My particular interest lies in the latest advancements in neural language models, especially those built on the transformers architecture like BERT and GPT variants. I am keen on exploring their potential in applications such as question answering and text generation for varying purposes.

My academic background includes an MA in Language Technology from the University of Helsinki, which also fueled my interest in both front-end and back-end web development. This comprehensive education in computer science has broadened my skill set across different technology domains.

Throughout my career, I have undertaken diverse roles, including positions as an IT support agent, localization engineer, and front-end developer ([Revita project](https://revita.cs.helsinki.fi/)). For a detailed view of my educational and professional background, please refer to my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilmari-kylli%C3%A4inen-71a1a818a/) page and [CV](/images/kylliainenilmari-cv-2022.pdf).

Currently, I am working as a software developer at Front AI, a company focused on Conversational AI and customer service channel optimization. This role effectively integrates my expertise and interest in language technology, as Front AI develops solutions that utilize AI to automate and enhance customer service interactions, a field closely related to my specialization in language models and web development.
